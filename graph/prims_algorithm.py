"""
perform prims algorithm to find minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph
1. Take any vertex as a source set its weight to 0 and all other verticesâ€™ weight to infinity
2. For every adjacent vertices if the current weight is more than current edge then we set it
to current edge
3. Then we mark current vertex as visited
4. Repeat these steps for all vertices in increasing order of weight
